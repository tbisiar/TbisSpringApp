          <br>  I am a dedicated engineer who thrives off of exploration and creation.  I thoroughly enjoy taking deep dives into challenging engineering problems whether Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, or what have you.  I particulary enjoy projects with small ngative environmental impact and large positive societal impact.  For this reason, I have gravitated toward software engineering as my chosen profession.
          <br>
          <br>  In my personal time I enjoy challenging myself physically and mentally by running, biking, skateboarding, cliff diving, playing music, and experimenting with new software development methodologies and frameworks.
